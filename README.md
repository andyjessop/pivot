Pivot is a tool for managing deployment of your projects. It is also a framework for building application code in a way that is fast, easy to test, and maintainable.

In the new paradigm of AI-driven development, it is important to make it easy for AI helpers to understand your code. Pivot decouples state updates from services from business logic, giving AI helpers a clear path to hyper-rapid development.
